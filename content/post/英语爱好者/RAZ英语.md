<div class="class";>A Golden Tragedy</div>
<div class="my-class";>    Long, long ago in a far-off land, there lived a very wealthy and kind king. <br>
King Midas had everything anyone could hope for. He had immense wealth, <br>
a peaceful kingdom, and a beautiful daughter, <br>
whom he loved dearly. <br>
Yet despite his good fortune, the king had one weakness.<br>
 He wanted more. Most of all, he wanted to please his devoted daughter Penelope. <br></div>
<div style="display:none;" id="hiddenContent">
<div class="golden-frame"><img src="/img/02.png"></div>
Penelope cared though the plumpest, most beautiful birds in all the land. She left little<br>
 doubt that she liked feathered creatures such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese <br>
best of all the animals on earth. Their feathers closely he landed in the bright sunshine<br>
 and the cluckers, gobblers, quACKers, and honkers clucked, gobbled, quacked, aquacked,<br>
 and honked musical notes with golden tones.<br>
Every day but Tuesday, each bird laid three eggs that seemed bigger than melons. But that <br>
was not good enough for Penelope. She wanted her fowl to lay golden eggs, too. Since the<br>
 king never wanted to disappoint his daughter, he set off to visit a wise wizard to enlist his help.<br>
<div class="golden-frame"><img src="/img/03.png"></div>
King Midas asked the wizard for one wish."And what is your wish?" the wizard asked.Without thinking <br>
of the consequences,which was his usual way, King Midasstated, "I would like the power to turn anything I<br>
 touch into gold."The wizard, bewildered by the request,said, "But you are already the wealthiest man in<br>
any kingdom. What could you possibly do with more gold?"King Midas simply said, "It is more important <br>
that I keep my daughter happy.""Someday you will regret this," the wizard warned before casting the spell.<br>
The king fixed his thoughts on delighting his daughter. He didn't even bother to inquire why the wizard <br>
thought he would later regret his wish.This would prove to be a tragic mistake.<br>
<div class="golden-frame"><img src="/img/04.png"></div>
The king traveled the road back to the palace, testing his new power. His path became littered with golden <br>
rocks and bordered by glistening flowers and trees with leaves of gold. The King saw only the golden hue of<br>
 everything around him. He failed to notice that his kingdom turned stiff and still in his wake.<br>
<div class="golden-frame"><img src="/img/05.png"></div>
<div class="golden-frame"><img src="/img/06.png"></div>
Excited, he entered the palace and ordered the chef to prepare a feast. <br>
From there he walked to the royal barnyard. He went from nest to nest turning each egg to gold. <br>
The royal dinner bell rang calling the king to his feast. <br>
He sat down and instantly his chair became a golden throne. <br>
When he picked up his fork, it too turned to gold, along with his bite of roasted pheasant. <br>
He picked up his goblet and—presto!—it changed from silver to gold. <br>
As the liquid inside touched his lips, it became solid gold.<br>
<div class="golden-frame"><img src="/img/07.png"></div>
"What is this!" exclaimed the king.  <br>
"What have I done? What ever shall  <br>
I drink or eat?"  <br>
Just then Penelope came running  <br>
into the room, dancing about in great  <br>
excitement.  <br>
"Father, Father," she shouted with glee.  <br>
"Look what I found in the barnyard  <br>
nests! Golden eggs!"  <br>
She threw her arms around her father's  <br>
neck and gave him a huge hug.  <br>
As one might expect, a tragedy occurred.  <br>
Penelope froze in her loving embrace,  <br>
still as a statue.  <br>
"Oh my, what have I done," King Midas  <br>
cried. "My daughter will never speak  <br>
loving words to me again. She will never  <br>
wrap her soft arms around me. What  <br>
ever will I do?"  <br>
<div class="golden-frame"><img src="/img/08.png"></div>
<div class="golden-frame"><img src="/img/09.png"></div>
King Midas worked himself into a  <br>
frenzied panic. He paced in circles.  <br>
He dithered and fretted. Then it struck  <br>
him. He had to return to the wizard  <br>
and ask for another wish.  <br>
Hurriedly the king mounted his horse,  <br>
but before it took two steps it hardened  <br>
into gold. The troubled king marched  <br>
double-time to the wizard's cottage  <br>
on the edge of his kingdom.  <br>
When he arrived, he rushed to the door  <br>
and rapped furiously.  <br>
'Let me in, let me in," his voice quivered  <br>
and quaked.  <br>
The wizard magically opened his now <br> 
golden door, and King Midas bolled in.  <br>
"You must grant me another wish," the  <br>
King demanded. "I have made a terrible  <br>
mistake. Please," he begged, "turn all  <br>
that I have touched back to what it was."  <br>
<div class="golden-frame"><img src="/img/10.png"></div>
<div class="golden-frame"><img src="/img/11.png"></div>
"The only way I can do that is to take  <br>
away ALL the gold and glitter that  <br>
surrounds you," warned the wizard.  <br>
"Even that which you had before this  <br>
greedy goldten touch overtook you.  <br>
Only then can the spell be reversed.  <br>
Do you understand?"  <br>
urged the king wildly. <br> 
With a flick of his wrist, the wizard  <br>
removed the power that had become  <br>
the King's curse.  <br>
King Midas's clothes became drab and  <br>
common. His palace shrank into a  <br>
humble house. The King lost all that  <br>
made him wealthy, but gained  <br>
something far more precious—his  <br>
daughter. He learned that there was  <br>
much more to life than glitter and gold.
